Odin landing page project

My attempt at a landing page following the Odin Project instructions. By the time I complete this project I hope to have learned how to effectively deploy CSS with particular focus on flexbox.

2022-05-18 Update
I have made a page which looks fairly close to the assignment image. Suspect I have over-complicated things and haven't got everything quite right. But I do feel more confident using flexbox than before starting the project.
